//Iteration

//repeating a section of code multiple times so we can have a new output

//Sequel try catch are an example of Go To

// go to are for exceptions

//While Do loop

  // base case different than other things


//For each short form for collections

// use for loops for nested iterations


// for Loop parts





for (i = 0; i <10 ; i++)

  accumulator // can use multiple i=0, j=0, d=3

  conditional or exit

  incremental // sometimes needs a function

  Loop invariants

  // non stable algorithms
    //memory and cpu are increasing and will crash eventually

  // dont modify collection you are iterating on
  // change incrementors on exits

  while(!exit){

    Draw Screen()
    Scan for Input()

  }


Recursion

not ever needed

faster to write

function that defines itself within itself

// two important parts

  // Heap and Stack

    //Stack
      // everytime you write a function it costs memory


  //fibonachi
    multiple function calls in a single line
